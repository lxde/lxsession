Description: a lightweight X11 session manager
 LXSession is a lightweight X11 session manager with fewer dependencies,
 designed for use with the LXDE(Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment).
 It derived from XSM and have following differences:
  * Removed the session dialog from xsm.
  * Stripped down without session restore function.
  * Automaticlly restart specific program if crashes happened.
  * Use better configuration.
  * Provide a nice logout-dialog with the ability to 
    shutdown/reboot/suspend/hibernate via HAL or gdm
  * Support halt/reboot LTSP thin clients,
 and more....
 .
 It's desktop-independent and can be used with any window manager.
 .
 As "session manager" lxsession used to automatically start a set of
 applications and set up a working desktop environment
 .
 LXSession has also a built-in lightweight Xsettings daemon, which can 
 configure GTK+ themes, keyboard, and mouse for you on session startup.
